# Hey!

I'm a web developer passionate about creating powerful responsive emails and landing pages for marketing campaigns and newsletters by leveraging strong HTML and CSS skills coupled with significant experience with Front-End development and client-side libraries such as Nuxt.js, Vue.js and React.

In my down time I enjoy writing [articles on coding](https://alexkasongo.medium.com/) and I am currently learning Javascript animation.
